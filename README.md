- Why does SwiftUI use structs for views?
- What is behind the main SwiftUI view?
- Why modifier order matters
- Why does SwiftUI use “some View” for its view type?
- Conditional modifiers
- Environment modifiers
- Views as properties
- View composition
- Custom modifiers

**CHALLENGE:**
1. _Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip._
1. _Go back to project 2 and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had._
1. _Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view._
